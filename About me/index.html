        <p style="text-indent: 100px; font-size: 22px;">  The question that comes to everyone's mind, "<i>Who is OBrien?"</i> The answer to this question can not be layed out in one simple webpage. It would take a complex, intricate website to fully explain. Lets start with the basics, I'm a red-haired, tall ginger with DNA traced back to Ireland and England. I did a 4 year stint in the US Navy, and visited many countries. I hope to travel around the world one day and see the <b>7</b> wonders. As I travel I would enjoy snowboarding down every mountain possible. Ofcourse bringing my wife, as I am unable to enjoy the world without her.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 100px; font-size: 22px;"> Despite the obvious travel bug, I am an extreme homebody and <b>love</b> laying on the couch and watching Netflix. I tend to keep to myself except game day. I suit up and head out to the baseball field where I meet up with my teammates and spend 3 hours throwing a small ball around a grass and dirt field. And like any homebody, once the game is over I am at home showered up on the couch. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 100px; font-size: 22px;"> These are just the main things I love to do with my life. All in all im a travel homebody who loves snowboarding and baseball with the boys!</p>
